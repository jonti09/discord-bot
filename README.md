# Discord Bot

This discord bot generates a random insult when you send a message to the bot and it is not a command!

To run the project locally, you need to fill the followinf prequisites!

* You will need [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
* You need to obtain a bot token and put it in `.env` file (Check the `.env.sample` file for more info)

Once done, run the following commands in root directory (where project was cloned)

```bash
npm i
npm start
```
